Moteur
======

Moteur is an _è´±bauche_ of a physics engine coded by @wookai and @fakufaku back around 2004 while undergrads at EPFL.

This was for fun and no profit :) Behold, all the comments are in french!

The code was fixed to build under OS X as of 2018-09-26. Simply running the following should compile and start an example.

    make
    ./test5
